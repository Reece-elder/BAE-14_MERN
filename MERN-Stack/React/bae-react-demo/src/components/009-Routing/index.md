## Routing

Routing allows us to 'imitate' a multiple page appliaction (about, shop, home etc.) as a single page application 

React app should NEVER refresh 
Refresh = Lose data, start connection again, start javascript again 
Single Page Application = Still have the ability to see 'different pages' but the app never refreshes 
All We are doing is choosing which components to render
