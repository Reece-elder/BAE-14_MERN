Using the skills we have covered up to this point you have been tasked with creating a simple website for an aquarium 

The website should feature a home page, about us page, nav bar, footer, results page and form page. 
Home page - List some basic information, use lorem ipsum, images and colours
Nav bar - allow you to link to all of the other pages
About us page - More text heavy page, use lorem ipsum again 
Results page - Let us view all of the fish or just some of the fish (by index maybe?)
Form page - Add fish to the arraylist, you should be able to specify the name, colour, age, diet of the fish 

The website should use routing to connect the pages together, state to transfer and save data and should have a consistent style across the website

You should make a brand new react project for this exercise to practice those skills as well

Stretch goal - Make an individual fish page that is only accessible by url "localhost:3000/fish/2"
This page will list some information about that specific fish! Such as the name, colour diet etc. Add extra information to your array if need be to make this page more detailed
